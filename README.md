# Art2MARKET demo plugin

## Install
1. [Download](https://github.com/khoallaby/art2market/archive/master.zip) and install the plugin
2. The Kint debugging libary is currently included as a single file, but some code is also in place to use it as a composer dependency. Run `composer install` to install it as such.
3. An admin page labeled as "Art2MARKET" on the sidebar should be accessible now and the input field is also able to save and read the saved data!
